## r-minimal
# Minimal Docker images for R

## What is R?

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and
MacOS. See more at https://www.r-project.org/

## Goals and features

The main goal of these images is to keep them minimal, so they can be used
as part of a bigger (web) application, or as a base image. Currently the
(R 4.1.0) `r-minimal` image is less than 21MB compressed, and 35.4MB
uncompressed.

All images use Alpine Linux.

The images include the `installr` tools that can install R packages from
CRAN or GitHub:

```
❯ installr -h
Usage: ./installr [ -c | -d ] [ -a pkgs ] [ -t pkgs ] [ -r ] [ -p ] REMOTES ...

Options:
  -c    install C and C++ compilers and keep them
  -d    install C and C++ compilers, temporarily
  -a    install Alpine packages and keep them
  -t    install Alpine packages, temporarily
  -p    do not remove pak after the installation (ignored if -r is given).

REMOTES may be:
  * package names from CRAN/Bioconductor, e.g.    ggplot2
  * slugs of GitHub repos, e.g.                   tidyverse/ggplot2
  * GitHub branch, tag or commit, e.g             tidyverse/ggplot2@v1.0.0
  * URLs to package .tar.gz files, e.g.           url::https://x.com/pkg.tar.gz
  * path to a local directory, e.g.               local::.
```

Recent r-minimal containers use pak (https://github.com/r-lib/pak) for R
packages installation. If you have problems with pak, or need to install
a package from a source that pak does not support, but the remotes package
does, then install the remotes package first.

## Limitations

To keep the images minimal, they do not include a number of parts and
features that most users would prefer to have for interactive R
development:

* Recommended R packages are not installed.
* Documentation is not included.
* No X11 support.
* No Java support.
* No OpenMP support.
* No JPEG, PNG or TIFF support.
* No Cairo support.
* No Tcl/Tk support.
* No translations, only English.
* The image does not have C, C++ or Fortran compilers.
* Limited time zone data: `GMT`, `UTC` and `America/New_York`, see
  below if you need better time zone data.

## Usage

Get the image from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rhub/r-minimal):

```
docker pull docker.io/rhub/r-minimal:latest
```

or from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=latest):

```
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/r-minimal:latest
```

## Platforms

All images are available on `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms.

## Supported R versions

Currently we support the last patch version of the last five minor R
versions. The `latest` tag always uses the last R release.

image  | tags   | note
------ | ------ | ----

[R 4.1.3](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=4.1.3)  | `4.1.3`, `4.1`, `latest` |
[R 4.1.3 patched](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=patched)  | `4.1.3-patched`, `4.1-patched`, `patched` | Built daily

## Dockerfile examples

One of our main goals is to be able to use `rhub/r-minimal` as a base
image, and easily add R packages from CRAN or GitHub to it, to create a
new image. Run `installr` from a `Dockerfile` to add R packages to
the `r-minimal` image:

```
FROM rhub/r-minimal
RUN installr praise
CMD [ "R", "--slave", "-e", "cat(praise::praise())" ]
```

Package with compiled code:

```
FROM rhub/r-minimal
RUN installr -d glue
```

After the package(s) have been installed, `installr` removed the compilers,
as these are typically not needed on the final image. If you want to keep
them use `installr -c` instead of `installr -d`.

Package with system requirements:

```
FROM rhub/r-minimal
RUN installr -d -t linux-headers pingr
CMD [ "R", "-q", "-e", "pingr::is_online() || stop('offline')" ]
```

Similarly to compilers, system packages are removed after the R packages
have been installed. If you want to keep (some of) them, use `installr -a`
instead of `installr -t`. (You can also mix the two.)

## Time zones

The image uses R's internal time zone database, but most time zones are
removed from, to save space. The only supported ones are `GMT`, `UTC` and
`America/New_York`. If you need more time zones, then install Alpine's
time zone package and point R to it:
```
apk add --no-cache tzdata
export TZDIR=/usr/share/zoneinfo
```

## Known failures and workarounds

* The ps package needs the `linux-headers` Alpine package at compile time.
  Many tidyverse packages depend on ps, so they'll need it as well:
  ```
  installr -d -t linux-headers ps
  ```

* The arrow package are hard to install, because Alpine Linux does
  not have the required libraries. For the details, please see:
  https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/issues/7

* The V8 package does not compile on Alpine Linux by default. Luckily,
  you can now download a static binary of V8:
  ```
  DOWNLOAD_STATIC_LIBV8=1 installr -d -t curl-dev V8
  ```

* The prophet package depens on V8, through rstan, and you can use the same
  trick to install it:
  ```
  DOWNLOAD_STATIC_LIBV8=1 installr -d -t "linux-headers gfortran curl-dev" prophet
  ```

* The readxl package does not compile on Alpine Linux currently.
  You can install this branch from GitHub:
  ```
  installr -d gaborcsardi/readxl@fix/alpine-linux
  ```

* The tidyverse package depends on readxl, so you'll need to do the same:
  ```
  installr -d -t "curl-dev libxml2-dev linux-headers gfortran" \
      -a "libcurl libxml2" gaborcsardi/readxl@fix/alpine-linux tidyverse
  ```

* To install the magick package, you need both the `imagemagick` and 
  `imagemagick-dev` Alpine packages, both at install time and run time:
  ```
  installr -d -a "imagemagick imagemagick-dev" -t "curl-dev" magick
  ```
